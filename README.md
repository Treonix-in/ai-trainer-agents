# Agent Lightning⚡


**The absolute trainer to light up AI agents.**

## ⚡ Core Features

- Turn your agent into an optimizable beast with **ZERO CODE CHANGE** (almost)! 💤
- Build with **ANY** agent framework (LangChain, OpenAI Agent SDK, AutoGen, CrewAI, Microsoft Agent Framework...); or even WITHOUT agent framework (Python OpenAI). You name it! 🤖
- **Selectively** optimize one or more agents in a multi-agent system. 🎯
- Embraces **Algorithms** like Reinforcement Learning, Automatic Prompt Optimization, Supervised Fine-tuning and more. 🤗

## ⚡ Installation

```bash
pip install agentlightning
```

For the latest nightly build (cutting-edge features), you can install from Test PyPI:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ agentlightning
```

## ⚡ Architecture

Agent Lightning keeps the moving parts to a minimum so you can focus on your idea, not the plumbing. Your agent continues to run as usual; you can still use any agent framework you like; you drop in the lightweight `agl.emit_xxx()` helper, or let the tracer collect every prompt, tool call, and reward. Those events become structured spans that flow into the LightningStore, a central hub that keeps tasks, resources, and traces in sync.

On the other side of the store sits the algorithm you choose, or write yourself. The algorithm reads spans, learns from them, and posts updated resources such as refined prompt templates or new policy weights. The Trainer ties it all together: it streams datasets to runners, ferries resources between the store and the algorithm, and updates the inference engine when improvements land. You can either stop there, or simply let the same loop keep turning.

No rewrites, no lock-in, just a clear path from first rollout to steady improvement.
